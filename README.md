## 👋 About Me

Greetings, wanderer of repositories.

I am **Gabriel**, a devoted student of Software Engineering, presently crafting my foundation through the **ALX Front-End Web Development** programme. My pursuits lie at the intersection of logic and lyricism, where lines of code meet lines of verse.

### 💼 What I Do

- 💻 I write code in **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- 🌐 Currently learning **React** and exploring responsive web development.
- 🛠️ Working on projects that combine logic, structure, and visual elegance.

### 🎵 Beyond the Code

- 🎹 **Gospel Pianist** – I believe music speaks where words fall silent.
- ✍️ **Poet by Inspiration** – I write not to impress, but to express.
- 📚 **Ever the Student** – Reading, reflection, and refinement are my daily devotions.

*"I am not yet what I shall be. But here, line by line, commit by commit, I build him."*

📫 Feel free to connect or collaborate. I welcome the company of fellow builders, artists, and seekers.
